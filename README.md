<h1>Virtual Network Attack and Defense Simulation</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project demonstrates the setup of a virtualized environment on VirtualBox, where two distinct operating systems—Kali Linux and Ubuntu—interact within a controlled network. Kali Linux, a security-focused distribution, is used to simulate cyberattacks, while Ubuntu acts as the target system, defending itself using the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) to control incoming and outgoing traffic. The goal of this project is to create a hands-on lab to understand and practice ethical hacking, network security, and firewall configuration.
<br />


<h2>Objectives</h2>
1. Set up Kali Linux and Ubuntu on VirtualBox <br />
2. Establish a Virtual Network <br />
3. Simulate Cyberattacks using Kali Linux <br />
4. Implement Security Measures on Ubuntu <br />
5. Monitor attack using Wireshark <br />
6. Evaluate the Effectiveness of the Firewal <br />

<h2> Utilities and Environments Used</h2>

- Virtual Box <br />
- Kali Linux <br />
- Ubuntu <br />
- UFW Firewall <br />
- Wireshark <br />
- Networking <br />


<h2>Expected Results:</h2>

- A secure Ubuntu system that successfully defends against simulated attacks from Kali Linux using customized UFW firewall rules. <br />
- An understanding of how Kali Linux exploits vulnerabilities and how firewalls like UFW can mitigate these risks. <br />
